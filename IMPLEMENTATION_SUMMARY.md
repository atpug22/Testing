# Team-Based Access Control - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Role Hierarchy System**
- Created `Role` enum with 4 levels: CTO ‚Üí Engineering Head ‚Üí Engineering Manager ‚Üí Engineer
- File: `app/models/role.py`

### 2. **Team Model**
- Teams with name, description, and manager
- Many-to-many relationship with users (team members)
- File: `app/models/team.py`

### 3. **User Model Extensions**
- Added `role` field (defaults to Engineer)
- Added `manager_id` for reporting hierarchy
- Added relationships: `teams`, `managed_teams`, `manager`, `direct_reports`
- File: `app/models/user.py`

### 4. **PullRequest Model**
- Tracks GitHub PRs with author and team
- Includes LogPose domain enums: `PrimaryStatus`, `FlowBlocker`, `RiskFlag`
- File: `app/models/pull_request.py`

### 5. **Access Control Enhancements**
- Added `TeamPrincipal` for team-based permissions
- Updated `get_user_principals()` to include role and team principals
- Files: `core/security/access_control.py`, `core/fastapi/dependencies/permissions.py`

### 6. **Repositories**
- `TeamRepository`: Team management and member operations
- `PullRequestRepository`: PR queries by author, team, status
- `UserRepository`: Extended with team/manager join methods
- Files: `app/repositories/team.py`, `app/repositories/pull_request.py`, `app/repositories/user.py`

### 7. **Controllers**
- `TeamController`: Team business logic
- `PullRequestController`: PR business logic
- Files: `app/controllers/team.py`, `app/controllers/pull_request.py`

### 8. **Factory Integration**
- Added factory methods: `get_team_controller()`, `get_pull_request_controller()`
- File: `core/factory/factory.py`

### 9. **Database Migration**
- Migration file: `migrations/versions/20241002_add_team_and_hierarchy.py`
- Adds: `teams`, `team_members`, `pull_requests` tables
- Extends: `users` table with `role`, `manager_id`

## üîê Access Control Rules

### Pull Request Access
| Role | Access Level |
|------|-------------|
| **CTO** | All PRs across organization |
| **Engineering Head** | All PRs in their teams |
| **Engineering Manager** | All PRs in their team |
| **Engineer** | Only their own PRs |

### Implementation
- PR authors: Full permissions (READ, EDIT, DELETE)
- Team members/managers: READ permission via `TeamPrincipal`
- CTO/Admin: Full permissions on all resources

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Run Migration
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 2. Create Sample Data
```python
# Create CTO
cto = await user_controller.create({
    "username": "cto",
    "email": "cto@logpose.com",
    "password": "hashed_password",
    "role": Role.CTO
})

# Create Engineering Manager
em = await user_controller.create({
    "username": "engineering_manager",
    "email": "em@logpose.com",
    "password": "hashed_password",
    "role": Role.ENGINEERING_MANAGER,
    "manager_id": cto.id
})

# Create Team
team = await team_controller.create({
    "name": "Backend Team",
    "description": "Backend engineering team",
    "manager_id": em.id
})

# Create Engineer
engineer = await user_controller.create({
    "username": "engineer",
    "email": "engineer@logpose.com",
    "password": "hashed_password",
    "role": Role.ENGINEER,
    "manager_id": em.id
})

# Add engineer to team
await team_controller.add_member(team, engineer)

# Create PR
pr = await pr_controller.create({
    "github_pr_id": 12345,
    "title": "Add new feature",
    "github_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/12345",
    "status": "open",
    "author_id": engineer.id,
    "team_id": team.id
})
```

### 3. Implement API Endpoints

Create routes in `api/v1/teams/` and `api/v1/pull_requests/`:
- `GET /teams` - List teams (filtered by access)
- `POST /teams` - Create team (CTO/Eng Head only)
- `GET /teams/{id}` - Get team details
- `POST /teams/{id}/members` - Add member
- `GET /pull-requests` - List PRs (filtered by access)
- `GET /pull-requests/{id}` - Get PR details
- `GET /users/{id}/team-members` - Get team member page data

### 4. Integrate with GitHub
- Set up webhook handlers for PR events
- Sync PR data to `pull_requests` table
- Map GitHub users to LogPose users
- Populate LogPose domain fields (PrimaryStatus, FlowBlockers, RiskFlags)

### 5. Build Frontend Components
- Team member page (Snapshot, Analytics, Timeline tabs)
- Team hierarchy view
- PR dashboard with access control
- Role-based navigation/visibility

## üìã Key Design Decisions

1. **Role-Based + Team-Based Access**: Combines role hierarchy with team membership for flexible access control
2. **Principal System**: Extends existing ACL system with `TeamPrincipal` for seamless integration
3. **Lazy Loading**: All relationships use `lazy="raise"` to prevent N+1 queries
4. **Self-Referential Manager**: Users can manage users, enabling org hierarchy
5. **Association Table**: `team_members` allows many-to-many user-team relationships
6. **LogPose Domain Language**: Enums match the master context (PrimaryStatus, FlowBlocker, RiskFlag)

## üîç Testing Access Control

```python
# Test as Engineer (can only see own PRs)
engineer_prs = await pr_controller.get_by_author(engineer.id)
# Attempting to access teammate's PR will raise 403

# Test as Engineering Manager (can see all team PRs)
team_prs = await pr_controller.get_by_team(team.id)
# Access granted via TeamPrincipal

# Test as CTO (can see all PRs)
all_prs = await pr_controller.get_all()
# Access granted via RolePrincipal("cto")
```

## ‚ú® Features Ready for LogPose

The implementation is ready for:
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical team management
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control
- ‚úÖ PR tracking with team context
- ‚úÖ Manager-employee relationships
- ‚úÖ LogPose domain enums (PrimaryStatus, FlowBlocker, RiskFlag)
